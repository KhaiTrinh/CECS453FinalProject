<!--Description-->
<h2> Description </h2>
<p> For our final project, we were tasked to come up with a project idea. We wanted to make an app that utilized most of what we learned in our summer class with an additional of wanting to implement Firebase. </p>
<p> Our app's function is to be able to allow the user to upload images to our database, and allow said user to view all of their uploaded images anytime they want as long as they can connect to our database </p>
